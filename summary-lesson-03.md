# Lesson 3: Queries with Constraints (Pt. 2)

## âœ… Summary:
This lesson focused on text-based filtering using SQL `WHERE` clause with operators suited for string data.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings:
- `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` allow pattern matching with `%` and `_`
- `IN` and `NOT IN` can filter from multiple values
- Wildcards make string filtering flexible and powerful

## ðŸ“Œ Queries Practiced:
- Find all Toy Story movies
- Get all films by John Lasseter
- Filter films not directed by John Lasseter
- Match wildcard titles like `WALL-*`

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments:
- Tried prefix and suffix pattern matching
- Used string length tricks with underscores (`_`)
- Combined `NOT IN` with multiple conditions
