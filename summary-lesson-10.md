# ✅ Lesson 10: Queries with Aggregates (Part 1)

## 🔍 Focus:
Mastering aggregate functions like `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `SUM` to extract insights from grouped or entire datasets — using the Employees table.

## 🧠 Core Learnings:
- `MAX()` and `MIN()` return extremes from a column.
- `AVG()` finds the average for numerical data, useful when grouped.
- `SUM()` totals up values for aggregate summaries.
- `GROUP BY` enables aggregation *per group/category* (e.g., per role or per building).

## ✅ Tasks Solved:
1. ✅ Found the longest tenure in the company.
2. ✅ Calculated average years of experience per role.
3. ✅ Aggregated total years worked per building.

## 🧪 Bonus Insights:
- Counted employees in each role.
- Measured min and max tenure per building.
- Calculated average studio-wide employee tenure.
- Ranked roles by average tenure.
- Summed total working years across the studio.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases:
- HR analytics for employee experience insights.
- Team workload or veteran distribution analysis.
- Infrastructure planning via cumulative employee time spent per building.
- Role-based performance tenure evaluations.
