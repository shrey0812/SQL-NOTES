# 🧠 Summary – Lesson 01: SELECT Basics

## ✅ What I Learned:
- How to retrieve specific columns using `SELECT column FROM table`
- Use of `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns
- `FROM` clause defines the data source

## 🔬 Experiments I Tried:
- Custom column selections (e.g., title + length)
- Used `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT` clauses
- Applied filters to simulate real-world queries

## 💡 Key Insight:
Simple changes in SELECT clauses can completely change the data shape — it's important to know when to use full selection vs focused querying.
