# âœ… Lesson 01 â€“ SELECT Basics

## ðŸ“˜ Concept
Learned how to write basic `SELECT` queries to retrieve data from one or more columns in a table. Introduced the use of `SELECT *` to retrieve all columns.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-World Use Case
Used in exploratory data analysis to view raw data from a table â€” e.g., when inspecting a movies database to get column details or fetch relevant attributes.

## ðŸ§  Notes
- `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;` is the standard pattern for querying specific data.
- `SELECT * FROM table;` is useful for quick inspection but not efficient for large datasets.
- Always specify column names in production for clarity and performance.
