# ✅ Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs (LEFT JOINs Only)

## 🔍 Focus:
Learning `LEFT JOIN` to preserve unmatched rows from the left table. Useful for pulling data even when no match exists in the right-side table (e.g., buildings with no employees).

## 🧠 Core Learnings:
- LEFT JOIN retains all rows from the left table.
- RIGHT JOIN and FULL JOIN are not available in this lesson but were conceptually explained.
- NULLs must be handled when data is missing in the joined table.

## ✅ Tasks Solved:
1. ✅ Listed all buildings that have employees.
2. ✅ Retrieved all buildings with capacity.
3. ✅ Listed all buildings with their distinct employee roles — including those with no employees.

## 🧪 Bonus Insights:
- Identified buildings without any employees.
- Counted total and unique roles per building.
- Computed average years of employment per building.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases:
- Useful in HR dashboards showing all departments, even those with no current employees.
- Infrastructure management where all facilities (buildings) must be accounted for regardless of usage.
