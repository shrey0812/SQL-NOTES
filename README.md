# 📊 SQLBolt Lessons: A Structured Journey to SQL Mastery

Welcome to my dedicated repository for mastering SQL fundamentals through **SQLBolt** – an interactive platform that teaches SQL through hands-on exercises. This repository serves as a documented proof of my commitment, learning process, and practical application of SQL concepts.

## 🚀 Why This Repository? (My Learning Philosophy)

In my journey towards becoming a proficient **Data Professional (Developer/Data Scientist)**, a strong command of SQL is indispensable. This project is a deliberate, step-by-step approach to build a solid foundation in SQL by:

* **Learning by Doing**: Actively solving interactive challenges, not just passively reading.

* **Structured Progression**: Following SQLBolt's well-designed curriculum from basic queries to advanced DDL operations.

* **Building Muscle Memory**: Consistently applying concepts to reinforce understanding.

* **Developing Rigidity-Breaking Skills**: Actively experimenting with queries beyond the given tasks to understand SQL's flexibility and edge cases.

* **Creating Verifiable Proof of Work**: Each lesson's solutions and detailed reflections are publicly available, showcasing my progress and attention to detail.

This is more than just a collection of solutions; it's a testament to a focused and disciplined learning approach.

## 📚 Repository Structure: Organized for Clarity

This repository is meticulously organized to allow easy navigation and understanding of my progress. Each SQLBolt lesson corresponds to a pair of files:

```
SQLBolt-Lessons/
├── Lesson-01-SELECT-Basics.sql
├── summary-lesson-01.md
├── Lesson-02-Filtering.sql
├── summary-lesson-02.md
├── Lesson-03-Constraints-Pt2.sql
├── summary-lesson-03.md
├── ... (continues for all completed lessons)
├── README.md             <-- You are reading this file!
└── (Future: summary.md, project_queries.sql for post-SQLBolt practice)
```

### Detailed File Breakdown:

* **`.sql` Files (e.g., `Lesson-XX-Topic.sql`)**:

  * Contains the **SQL query solutions** for all tasks within that specific SQLBolt lesson.

  * Each query is clearly commented with its purpose or the problem statement.

  * **Crucially**: Includes a dedicated "🔬 **Experiment Section**" with additional, self-designed queries that push the boundaries of the lesson's concepts, demonstrating deeper understanding and problem-solving initiative.

* **`summary-lesson-XX.md` Files (e.g., `summary-lesson-XX.md`)**:

  * A **detailed markdown document** providing a comprehensive summary of the lesson.

  * **✅ Core Concept**: Explains the main SQL concept introduced in the lesson (e.g., `SELECT` statements, `WHERE` clause, `CREATE TABLE`).

  * **🧠 Key Learnings**: Lists specific syntax, rules, and nuances learned.

  * **🛠️ Syntax Dissection**: Provides clear syntax examples for the commands introduced.

  * **🎯 Task Queries Recap**: Briefly reviews the official SQLBolt tasks and the approach to solving them.

  * **🧪 My Experiment Zone**: Highlights the specific custom queries I attempted, detailing the purpose and the insights gained from each experiment. This section underscores my commitment to active learning and breaking mental rigidity.

  * **🧠 Reflection**: Offers a personal reflection on the lesson's importance, potential pitfalls, and real-world applicability.

  * **🛣️ Next Steps**: Indicates the next lesson or learning phase.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning (SQL Concepts Covered)

This journey through SQLBolt systematically covers the core aspects of SQL, essential for any data role:

* **DQL (Data Query Language)**:

    * `SELECT` (basics, specific columns, all columns)

    * `WHERE` (filtering with various operators: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`)

    * `ORDER BY` (sorting results: `ASC`, `DESC`)

    * `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (pagination)

    * `DISTINCT` (removing duplicate rows)

    * `JOIN` operations (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`)

    * Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)

    * `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` (grouping data and filtering groups)

    * Subqueries

* **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:

    * `INSERT` (adding new rows)

    * `UPDATE` (modifying existing rows)

    * `DELETE` (removing existing rows)

* **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:

    * `CREATE TABLE` (defining new table structures, data types, and constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `DEFAULT`, `CHECK`)

    * `ALTER TABLE` (modifying existing table structures: adding/dropping columns, renaming tables)

    * `DROP TABLE` (removing entire tables)
