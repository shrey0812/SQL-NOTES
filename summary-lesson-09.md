# ✅ Lesson 09: Queries with Expressions

## 🔍 Focus:
Using SQL expressions to manipulate data inside queries — including arithmetic, string functions, and aliases — to create clearer, more useful output.

## 🧠 Core Learnings:
- SQL expressions let you transform data on the fly (e.g., combining columns, scaling values).
- You can apply arithmetic operations directly in SELECT.
- `AS` gives your expressions readable aliases.
- You can alias both columns and table names to shorten complex queries.

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
1. Combined domestic and international sales, scaled in millions.
2. Converted ratings to percentage format.
3. Filtered movies released in even-numbered years.

## 🧪 Experiments:
1. Calculated movie duration in hours and minutes using `FLOOR()` and `%`.
2. Found difference (profit gap) between international and domestic sales.
3. Measured title length with `LENGTH()`.
4. Computed revenue per minute of runtime.
5. Calculated each director’s average rating using `AVG()` with `GROUP BY`.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases:
- Reporting total revenue in dashboards.
- Normalizing metrics (e.g., sales per minute).
- Extracting useful metrics for content insights (title lengths, year filters).
- Evaluating team performance (like director rating averages).
