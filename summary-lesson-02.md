# 📘 Lesson 2: Queries with Constraints (Pt. 1)

## ✅ What I Learned
- The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.
- Logical operators like `AND`, `OR` can chain multiple constraints.
- Used relational operators: `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`.
- Queries become faster and more readable with focused conditions.

## 🛠️ Syntax Recap
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name
WHERE condition1
  AND condition2
  OR condition3;
